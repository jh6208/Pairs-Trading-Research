# Baseline Approach

Here we used both the cointegration ("Cointegration_Method.ipynb) and the Kalman fitering approaches ("Kalman Filter_BBand.ipynd") to design our 
baseline strategies. Here I thank my team member Jiayu Liu to contribute her work towards designing the baseline strategies. 

***Note: The "Kalman Filter_BBand.ipynb" file may be a little bit of messy due to the addtion of new ideas (i.e., drawing the graph for the final
paper report).
