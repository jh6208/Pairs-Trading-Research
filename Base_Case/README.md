# Baseline Approaches

Here, we used both the cointegration ("Cointegration_Method.ipynb) and the Kalman fitering approaches ("Kalman Filter_BBand.ipynd") to design our 
baseline strategies. Here, I thank my team member Jiayu Liu for contributing her work towards creating the baseline strategies. 

***Note: The "Kalman Filter_BBand.ipynb" file may be a little messy due to adding new ideas (i.e., drawing the graph for the final
paper report).***
