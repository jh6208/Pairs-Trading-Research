# Pair Selection

This folder only contains one jupyter notebook file, "Pair Selection.ipynb". This is the code implementation of the "Pairs Selection" section on our
final paper report.

***Note: This jupyter notebook may need some small revisions since I reorganized all of the codes (not running them after reorganization since it would take computers another whole afternoon or longer to complete all of the functions within "Pair Selection.ipynb") after I initially finished all of our wanted results.***
