This is my group source code to use baseline approaches (integrating of Kalman filter and of Cointegration), copulas method, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms to pair trade the U.S. equity indexes Russell 2000 and S&P400. Note that our finanl paper will publish on EMFRM (Economics, 
Mathematical Finance and Financial Risk Management), an international conference platform.

Note that the majority of the "ipynb" files are not organized perfectly. This is due to the fact that many small revisions occured during the 
code construction process and the ideas for me were updated sequentially. However, readers should expect that our source code will run as expected
once all of the required version of the jupyter notebook and python packages are installed correctly. Also, we collected all of our data directly
through the python package "yfinance", so there is no need for us to collect the data from other website or other computer techniques.

In addition to the paper research for support listed on the section "Reference",  the following resources provide a large support for our code's contribution.
