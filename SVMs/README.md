# Support Vector Machines Algorithms

This folder contains the main two jupyter notebooks "SVM Model Shorter Horizon_1.ipynb" and "SVM Model Spread Shorter Horizon_2.ipynb".
Also, the code organizations for the these jupyter notebooks are not fluent for the same reason. One can also try different (hyper)parameters and even
using the GridSearch approach for the hyperparameter tuning process. (However, it will take a long time for computers to finish this task, and the
optimized results might not be better than the ones we found out a lot...)

***Note: Both jupyter notebooks reference Pavlov [3].***
