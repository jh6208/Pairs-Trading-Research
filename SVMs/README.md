# Support Vector Machines Algorithms

This folder contains the main two jupyter notebooks "SVM Model Shorter Horizon_1.ipynb" and "SVM Model Spread Shorter Horizon_2.ipynb".
Also, the code organizations for these jupyter notebooks could be more fluent for the same reason. One can also try different (hyper)parameters and 
use the GridSearch approach for the hyperparameter tuning process. (However, it will take a long time for computers to finish this task, and the optimized results might not be significantly better than the ones we suggested....)

***Note: Both jupyter notebooks reference Pavlov [3].***
